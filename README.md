# Graduate-Admission-Prediction

This is an guided project through coursera.

Dataset Description :
Dataset contained just 500 rows of student data. Task was to predict their chances of getting into an University.

Model Description :
After visualizing the data it was clear that a linear model would be a perfect fit, however for exploratory purposes I also trained an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a Decision Tree Regressor and a Random Forest Regressor.
